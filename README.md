My frontend realisation of yandex's balaboba. Backend based on neural network API. Prompts by me

## Description
In this project I have made frontend realisation of text generation service like yandex's balaboba. I have used publicly avaliable neural network API. I have used the technique called zero-shot learning in order to achieve differnt text geneartion styles for different prompts. Making this project I have learned basic js syntax, fetch api, basic css and html. For a template I have used html5 boilerplate. For a deployment I have used github pages, because it provides CDN and it was a simple way to deploy my staic frontend project.
